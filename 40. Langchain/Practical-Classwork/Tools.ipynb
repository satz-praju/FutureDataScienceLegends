              "'Page: LangChain\\nSummary: LangChain is a software framework that helps facilitate the integration of large language models (LLMs) into applications. As a language model integration framework, LangChain\\'s use-cases largely overlap with those of language models in general, including document analysis and summarization, chatbots, and code analysis.\\n\\nPage: Vector database\\nSummary: A vector database, vector store or vector search engine is a database that uses the vector space model to store vectors (fixed-length lists of numbers) along with other data items. Vector databases typically implement one or more approximate nearest neighbor algorithms, so that one can search the database with a query vector to retrieve the closest matching database records.\\nVectors are mathematical representations of data in a high-dimensional space. In this space, each dimension corresponds to a feature of the data, with the number of dimensions ranging from a few hundred to tens of thousands, depending on the complexity of the data being represented. A vector\\'s position in this space represents its characteristics. Words, phrases, or entire documents, as well as images, audio, and other types of data, can all be vectorized.\\nThese feature vectors may be computed from the raw data using machine learning methods such as feature extraction algorithms, word embeddings or deep learning networks. The goal is that semantically similar data items receive feature vectors close to each other.\\nVector databases can be used for similarity search, semantic search, multi-modal search, recommendations engines, large language models (LLMs), object detection,  etc.\\nVector databases are also often used to implement retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), a method to improve domain-specific responses of large language models. The retrieval component of a RAG can be any search system, but is most often implemented as a vector database. Text documents describing the domain of interest are collected, and for each document or document section, a feature vector (known as an \"embedding\") is computed, typically using a deep learning network, and stored in a vector database. Given a user prompt, the feature vector of the prompt is computed, and the database is queried to retrieve the most relevant documents. These are then automatically added into the context window of the large language model, and the large language model proceeds to create a response to the prompt given this context.\\n\\nPage: Retrieval-augmented generation\\nSummary: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a technique that enables large language models (LLMs) to retrieve and incorporate new information. With RAG, LLMs do not respond to user queries until they refer to a specified set of documents. These documents supplement information from the LLM\\'s pre-existing training data. This allows LLMs to use domain-specific and/or updated information that is not available in the training data. For example, this helps LLM-based chatbots access internal company data or generate responses based on authoritative sources.\\nRAG improves large language models (LLMs) by incorporating information retrieval before generating responses. Unlike traditional LLMs that rely on static training data, RAG pulls relevant text from databases, uploaded documents, or web sources. According to Ars Technica, \"RAG is a way of improving LLM performance, in essence by blending the LLM process with a web search or other document look-up process to help LLMs stick to the facts.\" This method helps reduce AI hallucinations, which have caused chatbots to describe policies that don\\'t exist, or recommend nonexistent legal cases to lawyers that are looking for citations to support their arguments.\\nRAG also reduces the need to retrain LLMs with new data, saving on computational and financial costs. Beyond efficiency gains, RAG also allows LLMs to include sources in their responses, so users can verify the cited sources. This provides greater transparency, as us'"

Walpole is also the longest-serving British prime minister by this definition. The first prime minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland was William Pitt the Younger at its creation on 1 January 1801.

Robert Walpole is regarded as the first prime minister; he became First Lord of the Treasury of Great Britain in 1721.

            "Summary: During his second presidency, Donald Trump, president of the United States, triggered a global trade war after he enacted a series of steep tariffs affecting nearly all goods imported into the country. From January to April 2025, the average applied US tariff rate rose from 2.5% to an estimated 27%—the highest level in over a century. After changes and negotiations, the rate was estimated at 18.6% as of August 2025. By July 2025, tariffs represented 5% of federal revenue compared to 2% historically.\n",
            "Under Section 232 of the 1962 Trade Expansion Act, Trump raised steel, aluminum, and copper tariffs to 50% and introduced a 25% tariff on imported cars from most countries. New tariffs on pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and other sectors are under consideration.\n",
            "Trump also claimed unprecedented tariff authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). On April 2, 2025, he invoked the law to impose \"reciprocal tariffs\" on imports from all countries not subject to other sanctions. A universal 10% tariff took effect on April 5. Although plans for additional country-specific \"reciprocal tariffs\" were delayed in the wake of the 2025 stock market crash, they were ultimately implemented on August 7. The de minimis exemption was eliminated effective August 29, 2025 under the IEEPA; previously, packages valued below $800 were exempt from tariffs. Sweeping use of the IEEPA sparked a trade war with Canada and Mexico and escalated the China–United States trade war.\n",
            "Federal courts have ruled that the tariffs imposed under the IEEPA are illegal; however, they remain in effect while the case is appealed. In V.O.S. Selections, Inc. v. United States, the Court of Appeals allowed the IEEPA tariffs to stand until at least October 14, 2025, to give the government time to seek review by the Supreme Court. The rulings do not affect tariffs imposed under Section 232 or Section 301.\n",
            "The Trump administration argues that its tariffs will promote domestic manufacturing, protect national security, and substitute for income taxes. The administration views trade deficits as inherently harmful, a stance economists criticized as a flawed understanding of trade. Although Trump has said foreign countries pay his tariffs, US tariffs are fees paid by businesses that import foreign goods, which are then often passed on to US consumers. The tariffs contributed to downgraded GDP growth projections by the Federal Reserve, the OECD, and the World Bank.\n",

            "Summary: The Liberation Day tariffs are a broad package of import duties announced by U.S. President Donald Trump on April 2, 2025—a date he called \"Liberation Day\". In a White House Rose Garden ceremony, Trump signed Executive Order 14257, Regulating Imports With a Reciprocal Tariff to Rectify Trade Practices That Contribute to Large and Persistent Annual United States Goods Trade Deficits. This order declared a national emergency over the United States' trade deficit and invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to authorize sweeping tariffs on foreign imports.\n",
            "Trump also signed Executive Order 14256, Further Amendment to Duties Addressing the Synthetic Opioid Supply Chain in the People's Republic of China as Applied to Low-Value Imports, which closed the de minimis exemption for China, further escalating the China–United States trade war.\n",
            "Executive Order 14257 imposed a 10% baseline tariff on imports from nearly all countries beginning April 5, with country-specific tariff rates scheduled to begin April 9. The Trump administration called these measures \"reciprocal\", asserting they mirrored and counteracted trade barriers faced by U.S. exports. Trade analysts rejected this characterization, noting that the tariffs often exceeded those imposed by foreign countries and included countries with which the U.S. had a trade surplus. Economists argued that the formula used to calculate the \"reciproc\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mI now know the final answer\n",

            "Summary: Layla and Majnun (Arabic: مجنون ليلى majnūn laylā \"Layla's Mad Lover\"; Persian: لیلی و مجنون, romanized: laylâ o majnun) is an old story of Arab origin, about the 7th-century Arabian poet Qays ibn al-Mulawwah and his lover Layla bint Mahdi (later known as Layla al-Aamiriya).\n",
            "\"The Layla-Majnun theme passed from Arabic to Persian, Turkish, and Indic languages\", through the narrative poem composed in 1188 CE by the Persian poet Nizami Ganjavi, as the third part of his Khamsa. It is a popular poem praising their love story.\n",
            "Faisal and Layla fell in love with each other when they were young, but when they grew up, Layla's father did not allow them to be together. Qays became obsessed with her. His tribe Banu 'Amir, and the community gave him the epithet of Majnūn (مجنون \"crazy\", lit. \"possessed by Jinn\"). Long before Nizami, the legend circulated in anecdotal forms in Iranian akhbar. The early anecdotes and oral reports about Majnun are documented in Kitab al-Aghani and Ibn Qutaybah's Al-Shi'r wa-l-Shu'ara'. The anecdotes are mostly very short, only loosely connected, and show little or no plot development. Nizami collected both secular and mystical sources about Majnun and portrayed a vivid picture of the famous lovers. Subsequently, many other Persian poets imitated him and wrote their own versions of the romance. Nizami drew influence from Udhrite (Udhri) love poetry, which is characterized by erotic abandon and attraction to the beloved, often by means of an unfulfillable longing.\n",
            "Many imitations have been contrived of Nizami's work, several of which are original literary works in their own right, including Amir Khusrow Dehlavi's Majnun o Leyli (completed in 1299), and Jami's version, completed in 1484, amounting to 3,860 couplets. Other notable reworkings are by Maktabi Shirazi, Hatefi (died 1520), and Fuzuli (died 1556), which became popular in Ottoman Turkey and India. Sir William Jones published Hatefi's romance in Calcutta in 1788. The popularity of the romance following Nizami's version is also evident from the references to it in lyrical poetry and mystical masnavis—before the appearance of Nizami's romance, there are just some allusions to Layla and Majnun in divans. The number and variety of anecdotes about the lovers also increased considerably from the twelfth century onwards. Mystics contrived many stories about Majnun to illustrate technical mystical concepts such as fanaa (annihilation), divānagi (love-madness), self-sacrifice, etc. Nizami's work has been translated into many languages. The modern Arabic-language adaptation of the classical Arabic story include Shawqi's play The Mad Lover of Layla.\n",

It is directed by Sajid Ali, presented by Imtiaz Ali and co-produced by Ekta Kapoor, Shobha Kapoor and Preety Ali. A contemporary retelling of the legendary Arabic tragedy Layla and Majnun, it follows two star-crossed lovers, Laila (Dimri) and Qais Bhatt (Tiwary) who are unable to unite as they face opposition from their families. However, when fate intervenes, Laila marries another man while Qais goes to London. They reunite after four years, but end up waiting more for each other.\n",

It is directed by Sajid Ali, presented by Imtiaz Ali and co-produced by Ekta Kapoor, Shobha Kapoor and Preety Ali. A contemporary retelling of the legendary Arabic tragedy Layla and Majnun, it follows two star-crossed lovers, Laila (Dimri) and Qais Bhatt (Tiwary) who are unable to unite as they face opposition from their families. However, when fate intervenes, Laila marries another man while Qais goes to London. They reunite after four years, but end up waiting more for each other.\n",
            "Released theatrically on 7 September 2018, the film met with lukewarm response and failed commercially at the box office. But in later years, it received positive reviews for its story, cast performances and soundtrack, garnering critical acclaim. Following its digital release, many outlets even assigned the film cult status.\n",

            "Summary: Layla and Majnun (Arabic: مجنون ليلى majnūn laylā \"Layla's Mad Lover\"; Persian: لیلی و مجنون, romanized: laylâ o majnun) is an old story of Arab origin, about the 7th-century Arabian poet Qays ibn al-Mulawwah and his lover Layla bint Mahdi (later known as Layla al-Aamiriya).\n",
            "\"The Layla-Majnun theme passed from Arabic to Persian, Turkish, and Indic languages\", through the narrative poem composed in 1188 CE by the Persian poet Nizami Ganjavi, as the third part of his Khamsa. It is a popular poem praising their love story.\n",
            "Faisal and Layla fell in love with each other when they were young, but when they grew up, Layla's father did not allow them to be together. Qays became obsessed with her. His tribe Banu 'Amir, and the community gave him the epithet of Majnūn (مجنون \"crazy\", lit. \"possessed by Jinn\"). Long before Nizami, the legend circulated in anecdotal forms in Iranian akhbar. The early anecdotes and oral reports about Majnun are documented in Kitab al-Aghani and Ibn Qutaybah's Al-Shi'r wa-l-Shu'ara'. The anecdotes are mostly very short, only loosely connected, and show little or no plot development. Nizami collected both secular and mystical sources about Majnun and portrayed a vivid picture of the famous lovers. Subsequently, many other Persian poets imitated him and wrote their own versions of the romance. Nizami drew influence from Udhrite (Udhri) love poetry, which is characterized by erotic abandon and attraction to the beloved, often by means of an unfulfillable longing.\n",
            "Many imitations have been contrived of Nizami's work, several of which are original literary works in their own right, including Amir Khusrow Dehlavi's Majnun o Leyli (completed in 1299), and Jami's version, completed in 1484, amounting to 3,860 couplets. Other notable reworkings are by Maktabi Shirazi, Hatefi (died 1520), and Fuzuli (died 1556), which became popular in Ottoman Turkey and India. Sir William Jones published Hatefi's romance in Calcutta in 1788. The popularity of the romance following Nizami's version is also evident from the references to it in lyrical poetry and mystical masnavis—before the appearance of Nizami's romance, there are just some allusions to Layla and Majnun in divans. The number and variety of anecdotes about the lovers also increased considerably from the twelfth century onwards. Mystics contrived many stories about Majnun to illustrate technical mystical concepts such as fanaa (annihilation), divānagi (love-madness), self-sacrifice, etc. Nizami's work has been translated into many languages. The modern Arabic-language adaptation of the classical Arabic story include Shawqi's play The Mad Lover of Layla.\n",

            "Summary: The prime minister of the United Kingdom is the head of government of the United Kingdom. The prime minister advises the sovereign on the exercise of much of the royal prerogative, chairs the Cabinet, and selects its ministers. Modern prime ministers hold office by virtue of their ability to command the confidence of the House of Commons, so they are invariably members of Parliament.\n",
            "The office of prime minister is not established by any statute or constitutional document, but exists only by long-established convention, whereby the monarch appoints as prime minister the person most likely to command the confidence of the House of Commons. In practice, this is the leader of the political party that holds the largest number of seats in the Commons. The prime minister is ex officio also First Lord of the Treasury (prior to 1905 also the official title of the position), Minister for the Civil Service, the minister responsible for national security, and Minister for the Union. The prime minister's official residence and office is 10 Downing Street in London.\n",
            "Early conceptions of the office of prime minister evolved as the primus inter pares (\"first among equals\"); however that does not differentiate on status and responsibility upon whoever is holding office. Historically, the prime minister has never been the first among equals at any time prior to 1868. Until now, that characterisation of the prime minister is reflective of the democratic nature of their position. The power of the prime minister depends on the support of their respective party and on the popular mandate. The appointment of cabinet ministers and granting of honours are done through the prime minister's power of appointment. The prime minister alongside the cabinet proposes new legislation and decides on key policies that fit their agenda which are then passed by an act of parliament.\n",
            "The power of the office of prime minister has grown significantly since the first prime minister, Robert Walpole in 1721. Prime ministerial power evolved gradually alongside the office itself which have played an increasingly prominent role in British politics since the early 20th century. During the premierships of Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair, prime ministerial power expanded substantially, and their leaderships in the office were described as \"presidential\" due to their personal wielding of power and tight control over the cabinet. The prime minister is one of the world's most powerful political leaders in modern times. As the leader of the world's sixth largest economy, the prime minister holds significant domestic and international leadership, being the leader of a prominent member state of NATO, the G7 and G20.\n",
            "As of 2025 58 people (55 men and 3 women) have served as prime minister, the first of whom was Robert Walpole taking office on 3 April 1721. The longest-serving prime minister was also Walpole, who served over 20 years, and the shortest-serving was Liz Truss, who served seven weeks. Keir Starmer succeeded Rishi Sunak as prime minister on 5 July 2024, following the 2024 general election.\n",

            "There is no specific date for when the office of prime minister first appeared, as the role was not created but rather evolved over time through a merger of duties. The term was regularly, if informally, used by Robert Walpole by the 1730s. It was used in the House of Commons as early as 1805, and it was certainly in parliamentary use by the 1880s, although did not become the official title until 1905, when Henry Campbell-Bannerman was prime minister.  \n",

Under the U.S. Constitution, the officeholder leads the executive branch of the federal government and is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces.\n",
            "The first president, George Washington, won a unanimous vote of the Electoral College. The incumbent president is Donald Trump, who assumed office on January 20, 2025. Since the office was established in 1789, 45 men have served in 47 presidencies. The discrepancy is due to the nonconsecutive terms of Grover Cleveland (counted as the 22nd and 24th president) and Trump (counted as the 45th and 47th president).\n",
            "The presidency of William Henry Harrison, who died 31 days after taking office in 1841, was the shortest in American history. Franklin D. Roosevelt served the longest, over twelve years, before dying early in his fourth term in 1945. He is the only U.S. president to have served more than two terms. Since the ratification of the Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1951, no person may be elected president more than twice, and no one who has served more than two years of a term to which someone else was elected may be elected more than once.\n",
            "Four presidents died in office of natural causes (William Henry Harrison, Zachary Taylor, Warren G. Harding, and Franklin D. Roosevelt), four were assassinated (Abraham Lincoln, James A. Garfield, William McKinley, and John F. Kennedy), and one resigned (Richard Nixon, facing impeachment and removal from office). John Tyler was the first vice president to assume the presidency during a presidential term, setting the precedent that a vice president who does so becomes the fully functioning president with a new, distinct administration.\n",
            "Throughout most of its history, American politics has been dominated by political parties. The Constitution is silent on the issue of political parties, and at the time it came into force in 1789, no organized parties existed. Soon after the 1st Congress convened, political factions began rallying around dominant Washington administration officials, such as Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson. Concerned about the capacity of political parties to destroy the fragile unity holding the nation together, Washington remained unaffiliated with any political faction or party throughout his eight-year presidency. He was, and remains, the only U.S. president who never affiliated with a political party.\n",

Vice presidents have exercised this latter power to varying extents over the years. Two vice presidents—George Clinton and John C. Calhoun—served under more than one president.\n",

Originally, the vice president was the person who received the second-most votes for president in the Electoral College.

            "Summary: The president of the United States is the head of state and head of government of the United States, indirectly elected to a four-year term via the Electoral College. Under the U.S. Constitution, the officeholder leads the executive branch of the federal government and is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces.\n",
            "The first president, George Washington, won a unanimous vote of the Electoral College. The incumbent president is Donald Trump, who assumed office on January 20, 2025. Since the office was established in 1789, 45 men have served in 47 presidencies. The discrepancy is due to the nonconsecutive terms of Grover Cleveland (counted as the 22nd and 24th president) and Trump (counted as the 45th and 47th president).\n",
            "The presidency of William Henry Harrison, who died 31 days after taking office in 1841, was the shortest in American history. Franklin D. Roosevelt served the longest, over twelve years, before dying early in his fourth term in 1945. He is the only U.S. president to have served more than two terms. Since the ratification of the Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1951, no person may be elected president more than twice, and no one who has served more than two years of a term to which someone else was elected may be elected more than once.\n",
            "Four presidents died in office of natural causes (William Henry Harrison, Zachary Taylor, Warren G. Harding, and Franklin D. Roosevelt), four were assassinated (Abraham Lincoln, James A. Garfield, William McKinley, and John F. Kennedy), and one resigned (Richard Nixon, facing impeachment and removal from office). John Tyler was the first vice president to assume the presidency during a presidential term, setting the precedent that a vice president who does so becomes the fully functioning president with a new, distinct administration.\n",
            "Throughout most of its history, American politics has been dominated by political parties. The Constitution is silent on the issue of political parties, and at the time it came into force in 1789, no organized parties existed. Soon after the 1st Congress convened, political factions began rallying around dominant Washington administration officials, such as Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson. Concerned about the capacity of political parties to destroy the fragile unity holding the nation together, Washington remained unaffiliated with any political faction or party throughout his eight-year presidency. He was, and remains, the only U.S. president who never affiliated with a political party.\n",

            "The power of the presidency has grown since the first president, George Washington, took office in 1789. While presidential power has ebbed and flowed over time, the presidency has played an increasing role in American political life since the beginning of the 20th century, carrying over into the 21st century with some expansions during the presidencies of Franklin D. Roosevelt and George W. Bush. In modern times, the president is one of the world's most powerful political figures and the leader of the world's only remaining superpower. As the leader of the nation with the largest economy by nominal GDP, the president possesses significant domestic and international hard and soft power. For much of the 20th century, especially during the Cold War, the U.S. president was often called \"the leader of the free world\".\n",

Originally, the vice president was the person who received the second-most votes for president in the Electoral College. But after the election of 1800 produced a tie between Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr, requiring the House of Representatives to choose between them, lawmakers acted to prevent such a situation from recurring.
