    "### Observability Concepts in AgentCore\n",
    "This section defines the concepts of sessions, traces and spans as they relate to monitoring and observability of agents.\n",
    "        \n",
    "##### Sessions\n",
    "A session represents a complete **interaction context** between user and agent. Sessions encapsulate the entire conversation or interaction flow, maintaining state and context across multiple exchanges. Each session has a unique identifier and captures the full lifecycle of user engagement with the agent, from initialization to termination.\n",
    "##### Traces\n",
    "A trace represents a detailed record of a single request-response cycle beginning from with an agent invocation and may include additional calls to other agents. Traces capture the **complete execution path** of a request, including all internal processing steps, external service calls, decision points, and resource utilization. \n",
    "##### Spans\n",
    "A span represents a discrete, measurable **unit of work** within an agent's execution flow. Spans capture fine-grained operations that occur during request processing, providing detailed visibility into the internal components and steps that make up a complete trace. Each span has a defined start and end time, creating a precise timeline of agent activities and their durations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between these three observability components can be visualized as:\n",
    "- Sessions (highest level) - Represent complete user conversations or interaction contexts\n",
    "- Traces (middle level) - Represent individual request-response cycles within a session\n",
    "- Spans (lowest level) - Represent specific operations or steps within a trace\n"

    "### Step 1\n",
    "#### Examining how OpenTelemetry is configured with AgentCore\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable tracing of AI applications, we need to add the AWS Distro for Open Telemetry (ADOT) SDK  `aws-opentelemetry-distro` to your agent code. When using the `bedrock_agentcore_starter_toolkit` to configure your agent, it takes care of the opentelemetry instrumentation for you.\n",
    " More details are available [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/observability-configure.html#observability-configure-custom).\n",
    " 1. Open the Code server. Look for the deploy_agentcore/Dockerfile that was created as part of the deployment process in the previous lab.\n",
    "\n",
    " 2. Observe that it installs OpenTelemetry for you with RUN pip install aws-opentelemetry-distro>=0.10.1 and then runs it as part of the deployment process CMD [\"opentelemetry-instrument\", \"python\", \"-m\", \"xxx\"].\n",

    "This is a one-time setup to turn on Amazon CloudWatch Transaction Search. Follow the steps below to enable:\n",

    "1. Open the [CloudWatch Console](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=us-west-2)\n",
